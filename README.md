# Blogging API built using Fast-API and Postgres

The Blogger API enables you to integrate Blogger content with your application by using the REST APIs. Before you begin, you will need to set up secret token in [AuthO](https://auth0.com/docs/api).

For software requirements, I would recommend that your system should be installed with an <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">anaconda environment</a> and to run this project **execute the following command**:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For more help you can checkout [SQL Alchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/).

In case of need, feel free to ping me or create an issue.
